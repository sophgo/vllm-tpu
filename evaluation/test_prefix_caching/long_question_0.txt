"Large language models (LLMs) are advanced AI systems trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like language. They utilize deep learning architectures, such as transformers, to process and predict sequences of words. These models excel at tasks like text completion, translation, summarization, and question answering. Popular examples include OpenAI's GPT series, Google's Gemini, and Anthropic's Claude. Their performance depends on factors like training data quality, model size, and fine-tuning techniques. How do techniques like RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) improve the alignment of LLM outputs with human preferences?"
